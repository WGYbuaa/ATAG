# ATAG
This is the repository for our SANER'2024 paper "Test Architecture Generation by Leveraging BERT and Control and Data Flows". 

In industrial practices, test cases are often designed by test engineers based on the functionalities of the System under Test (SUT) in parallel and independently. This can lead to a lack of a comprehensive overview of the test architecture, hampering the reuse of test functions when implementing new test cases. To address this challenge, we propose ATAG, an automated test architecture generation approach, which employs an optimization algorithm to retrieve highly cohesive and loosely coupled test functions based on control flows and data flows. We also equip ATAG with a newly proposed BERT-based model, i.e., FunBERT, for generating test function specifications.
