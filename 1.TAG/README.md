# Running TAG:

Please run main() in main.py.  
You can choose different optimization strategies (e.g., ATAGcf, ATAGdf, and ATAGcf+df).  

For confidential reasons, we cannot show the test cases and run data,   
but we provide two demos.

It should be noted that the inputs of the demos we provided are the translated English test cases,
while the inputs of the paper are Chinese test case descriptions.
