# Running TAG:

Please run main() in main.py.  
You can choose different optimization strategies (e.g., ATAGcf, ATAGdf, and ATAGcf+df).  

For confidential reasons, we cannot show the test cases and run data,   
but we provide two demos.

It should be noted that the input of the demo we provided is the translated English test cases,
while the input of the original text is Chinese test case descriptions.
