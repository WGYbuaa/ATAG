# Running TAG:

Please run main() in main.py.  
You can choose different optimization strategies (e.g., ATAGcf, ATAGdf, and ATAGcf+df).  

For confidential reasons, we cannot show all the test cases in datasets and run data,   
but we provide multiple samples and demos of the test cases in the datasets.

It should be noted that the inputs of the demos we provided are the translated English test cases,
while the inputs of the paper are Chinese test case descriptions.
