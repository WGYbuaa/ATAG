In the demo, the numbers 0~11 indicate the initial test function,   
the list indicates the high-level test function,   
and the numbers in the list indicate the initial function called,  
where the level indicates the calling level.  


After analyzing the input test cases, ATAG identifies the shared control flow as follows:    
[0-Initialize the system, 1-Initialize the system, 2-Send business on the source node]/[6,7,8];    
The data flows formed by the operation "sdh1" are as follows：   
[2-Send business on the source node, 3-Activate the business, 4-Remove business],    
[8-Send business on the source node, 9-Inquire the business, 10-Deactivate the business].    


# Result:  
1. High-level functions generated by ATAGcf:    
[0-Initialize the system, 1-Initialize the system, 2-Send business on the source node]    
[6-Initialize the system, 7-Get source node resources, 8-Send business on the source node]  

2. High-level functions generated by ATAGdf:
